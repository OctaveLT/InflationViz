    description: `This project aimed to show the inflation rate in the EU. The inflation rate is the percentage change in the price of goods and services over a period of time. 
            It is an important indicator for measuring the health of an economy. You can see the inflation rate for each country in the EU and compare them with each other. 
            Feel free to hover over the countries to see the inflation rate in detail!`,
